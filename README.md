This is one of another modification to FrontAccounting. There may be bugs and I am not giving any warranty for my modifications.

1. When creating users we can enable or disable direct Gl posting for that user

2. In access setup we can enable or disable Modifying approval pending Gl Posting

3. Approver can approve,reject or void that transaction

4. Rejection and voiding will prompt for memo
